# StopMotionApp
Final year project at university. Developed an Android app to automatically capture images for stop motion animation in Android Studio using the image recognition feature of Google's ML Kit framework.
Written in Java and XML and bulk of main Java code can be found in app/src/main/java/com/example/stopmotionapp in the MainActivity and ImageAnalyzer classes.
An example of a video created entirely using images captured automatically by the app can be viewed here - https://youtu.be/BrTdPBYmr9E.
